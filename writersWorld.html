                <h2>Talk to a Friend</h2>
                    <P>You are your own worst enemy, and it's time that we change that. I sit here with a song on repeat, <em>Talk to a Friend</em> by Slaves (if you don't know this song go listen to it then come back). I do this because it is important to remember that we need to be kind to ourselves. . . <a href="talk-to-a-friend.html">read more</a></P>
                <h2>Cursed: A Demon's Haunting</h2>
                    <p>There is no sanctuary in this cold, dark room. The feelings of isolation and fear have completely consumed me and so I sit here with my back pressed into a corner, hoping that the walls are enough to hide me from the demon who haunts this place. He has not always been here, no. He followed me from my past. . . <a href="cursed.html">read more</a> </p>
                <h2>My Weird Mind</h2> 
                    <p>You will never understand my mind. It is weird, different, and always thinking. I have tired so hard and so many times to make people understand my thought process, to make people see the world as I see it; for if they did they could understand me. I would no longer have to be that weird girl in the corner. . .   <a href="my-weird-mind.html">read more</a></p>
