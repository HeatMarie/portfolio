                        What is there to say? Perhaps, I could say who I am, what I do and my reason for being here. For
                        doing this thing. If you are curious, let me tell you a story. It all began many, many years ago. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
    
                    <p>
                        Back when I was 14 years old, I pulled my Papa's C++ book off the bookshelf and opened it to the first chapter, the simple "Hello World". I struggled. Of course, I did. My attention span was a max of -1 and so was my self-confidence. I struggled with what ever coder and programmer in the world struggles with, our archnemesis, the semicolon.  If I would have known then that I was not the only human in the world who faught for hours over one small semicolon my life would have been different. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After years of talking to many folks who passed through my chair (I am currently a hair stylist), I have learned many people have struggled. Then one day during the Covid Pandemic, a friend suggested I give the world of coding one more shot. Little did I know, I would fall in-love with a world I once believed I wasn't cut out to be apart of.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So here I am, making amends and proving my 14 year old self wrong. I am currently enrolled at the University of Minnesota making my way through the Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp. And doing a pretty fine job, if I do say so myself.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>Each small step, may be small. But it is taking me down a path to a career that I will enjoy. I was told to always remember that enjoyment. And I made a promise that I will. And I don't break promises.</p>
